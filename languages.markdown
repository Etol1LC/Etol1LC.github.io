title: "Live Coding Languages"

---

I use a variety of languages for live coding depending on what I'm trying to achieve. They are all excellent live coding environments â€” each one is, in its own right, a work of art.

Here are some that I use:

- [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/)
- [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/)
- [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)
- [Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/)
- [Hydra](https://github.com/ojack/hydra)
- [Ixi Lang](http://www.ixi-audio.net/ixilang/)
- [Gibber](https://github.com/gibber-cc/gibber)
- [Punctual](https://github.com/dktr0/Punctual)
- [Marching](https://github.com/charlieroberts/marching)
- [Threnoscope](https://thormagnusson.github.io/threnoscope/)
- [Improviz](https://improviz.rumblesan.com/)

... and of course many others exist that I've never explored!
