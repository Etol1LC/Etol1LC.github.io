Etol (Claudio Donaggio) is an artist who sculpts sound through code. His live coding practice is a continuous exploration at the intersection of algorithmic composition, digital art, and improvisation.

Introduced to the world of creative coding in 2015 after witnessing a performance by Andrew Sorensen, Etol embarked on a journey of experimentation that has led him to become a recognizable voice in the electronic scene. With SuperCollider as his primary tool, his performances are a digital stream of consciousness, where complex rhythmic structures and glitch soundscapes emerge in real-time.

He performs regularly at numerous events and festivals in Italy and abroad. 

His album [Shell Shock(2021)](https://etol.bandcamp.com/), available on Bandcamp, is a faithful snapshot of his creative process: seven pure improvisations, recorded in a single live session, that bear witness to the expressive power of code as a musical instrument.

In 2021 he wrote a short piece on live coding which was included in the book ["Live Coding. A User's Manual"]("https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5495/Live-CodingA-User-s-Manual") by Alan F. Blackwell, Emma Cocker, Geoff Cox, Alex McLean, Thor Magnusson, and published by MIT Press in 2022.
He also contributed to the development of the [Threnoscope]("https://thormagnusson.github.io/threnoscope/") by Thor Magnusson.


Etol is available for performances, workshops, and collaborative projects. For booking inquiries, please proceed to the Contact page.
