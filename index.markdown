Hello, I am Etol (Claudio Donaggio), a live coder based in Venice, Italy.
I discovered the practice of live coding in 2015 when I saw a performance by Andrew Sorensen and, through his advice, I downloaded Sonic Pi and started my journey of learning and experimenting with code, music and digital art.
I perform regularly at gigs and streaming events, in Italy and abroad.
In February 2020 I have performed with Sam Aaron @Algorave-Prato.
My first live coding album [Shell Shock](https://etol.bandcamp.com/) has been released on Bandcamp on the 12th of November 2021. It consists of 7 live coded improvisations directly recorded with SuperCollider.
In case you'd like to support my work, go to the "contacts" section and book me for a gig!!!
THANKS :)
